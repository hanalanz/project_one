			<a href="picture.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;"><p>This work is by one of the most well known figures in graphic design, and especially typography,  Muller-Brockmann. Muller-Brockmann’s work is, in my opinion, is vital in the learning of all graphic design. I learned the grid system, which I now use all the time when designing. Before seeing his work I didn’t know what the grid system was and his posters show it so clearly. His posters were also my first introduction to traditional typography and they are a huge influence on the typography work that I do.</p></a>

			<p>This movie poster is for the movie Anatomy of a Murder. The poster was created by the designer Saul Bass, who created many posters and title sequences in the 50’s and 60’s for numerous movies. I was introduced to this poster when I was younger, by my parents who love the movie and it was my first real introduction into 50’s and 60’s graphic design, which I admire. I taught me that graphic design doesn’t solely have to be designed on the computer. Since seeing this poster I have been trying to do more design work using collage and hand drawn type. </p>
